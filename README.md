# X-Hub

For my final project, I created a website for students that attend Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters. The site allows students to keep up with the boarding school's events, attend events, create events, cancel events they've created, and delete attendances to events. Users will need to "register" to fully experience the site.

To run the application:
1. Download Xhub and open the solution with Visual Studio.
2. Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package manager Console.
3. Inside the Package Manager Console, enter: update-database
4. When the Package Manager is finished, run the application.

* **If you get this pop-up window:**
     * **Unable to start program 'http//localhost'**
     * **An operation is not legal in the current state**

1. Click Ok
2. Stop the application
3. Go to Tools > Options > Debugging > General
4. Uncheck "Enable JavaScript debugging for ASP.NET (Chrome and IE)"
5. Click Ok
6. Rerun application
